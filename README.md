System Analysis and Design

**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

The DriverPass project was developed for a client who wanted to create an online platform to help users preapre for their driver's license exams. They needed a system that could deliver instructional materials, schedule driving practice sessions, track student progress, and manage user accounts. The goal was to design an integrated web-based application that streamlined learning and test preparation.

**What did you do particularly well?**

I did a good job defining and organizing the system's main use cases and identifying clear actors for each function. My diagrams clearly showed how students, instructors, and administrators would interact with the platform. I also created detailed documentation that broke down each functional requirement in an accessible way.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I would revise the sequence diagrams. While they were accurate, they could have been more detailed in showing alternative flows and error handling. If I were to improve them, I'd expand each diagram to include edge cases and exceptions so the system's behavior would be fully documented.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

I analyzed the client's requirements by carefully studying the project brief and identifying what each user role needed to accomplish. For example, students needed an intuitive way to access lessons and track progress, while instructors needed tools to schedule and monitor sessions. I translated those needs into specific use cases and interface designs. Considering user needs is essential because a system is only successful if it solves real problems effectively and is easy to use. Ignoring user requirements risks developing a system that people can't or won't adopt.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

I start by gathering and clarifying requirements to ensure I understand what the client expects. Then, I create visual models, such as use case diagrams, class diagrams, and sequence diagrams, to map out functionality and workflows. Moving forward, I'd use additional techniques like creating user personas and wireframes early in the process to validate design assumptions. I'd also incorporate iterative feedback sessions to refine the system based on user input before implementation.
